# Simple IndexedDB lib
This is the alpha version of a very basic and simple to use IndexedDB lib, which can be used from javascript based web projects by simply including dbaccess.js

Currently the lib just supports the following use cases
- initializing an empty db with an arbitrary number of named object stores (aka "tables")
- storing items into an object store
- reading either one item or all items of an object store

There is also a very simple index.html page, showing how to embed and to use the lib.
